'name': 'I can’t come to church until I get my life together',

'series': 'Debunking',

'author': 'Henry Hazard',

'sermon': 'Nobody gets his life all together.  If you haven’t gotten it together by now, you won’t get it together by yourself.  You have already tried and had limited success.  God is in the business of helping people put their lives together.  He offers you peace, joy, fulfillment, love, and rest, among other blessings.  Jesus said, “I came that they may have life, and have it abundantly.”  Church is where God meets needy people.  Try it and see if God doesn’t meet you in your deepest need.'

'series': 'Debunking',

'author': 'Henry Hazard',

'sermon': 'Why not?  Moses was a murder.  David was a murderer and an adulterer.  But they turned to God and He forgave them and used them.  Why can’t He forgive you and use you in a special way?'

'name': 'I don’t go because of a bad experience with church people',

'series': 'Debunking',

'author': 'Henry Hazard',

'sermon': 'Everybody who goes to church has had a bad experience with church people at one time or another.  No church is perfect because it is made up of imperfect people.  Don’t let hypocrites run you away from God’s method of instructing you about Himself.  Use those experiences to help you grow and develop character qualities that honor the Lord and so you will not do anything to discourage people from coming to God and His church.'

'name': ' I don’t go because of the church’s beliefs and moral views',

'series': 'Debunking',

'author': 'Henry Hazard',

'sermon': 'If the church is teaching the Bible, its beliefs and moral views will be different from the world’s.  Both cannot be right.  It is your privilege to choose which you want to believe and follow.  You can believe what you want and hope that it is correct.  But the Bible states that it is God’s word.  God created this world and He created humans.  What He states in Scripture as doctrine and practice is from His perspective.  He speaks on His own authority.  When you disagree with Him, you are disagreeing based on you own authority or somebody else’s.  That is dangerous because you are saying that you know more than God about what is right and wrong.  Ultimately, God holds us accountable to His standard of righteousness, not to yours or to anybody else’s.'

'name': 'I don’t like organized religion',

'series': 'Debunking',

'author': 'Henry Hazard',

'sermon': 'So what do you like, disorganized religion?  Let’s define religion.  According to the definition of philosophers, religion is man’s search for God.  In every other “religion” a person has to work his way to heaven.  If he does enough good works maybe his good works will outweigh his bad and God will let him into heaven (or their term for heaven).  But there is no assurance that he will get there.  He hopes he will get there.  Christianity is not man’s search for God.  It is God’s search for man.  A person’s sin separates him from God.  God cannot let sin pollute His holy heaven.  Since we all are sinners, we are all lost.  But God sent His Son, Jesus, to pay for our sins on the cross.   Through Jesus we receive forgiveness of sins and the gift of eternal life.  Now anybody who trust Jesus to forgive him of his sins, has eternal life.  Christianity is not a religion.  It is a relationship with God through Jesus Christ.  We become His children.  He is our Father and He guides us in this life until it is over and then He takes us to be with Him for eternity.'

'name': 'I don’t have time to go to church',

'series': 'Debunking',

'author': 'Henry Hazard',

'sermon': 'Generally this is just an excuse.  We always seem to find time to do the things we want to.  Churches have different times for their service.  Some worship on Sunday mornings.  Some worship on Sunday afternoons.  Some worship on Sunday evenings.  Some have worship service on Saturday evenings or Wednesday evening.  You may not be able to attend church every time or every week, but you could find a church service somewhere that you could attend, if you really wanted to.'

'name': 'Is there some kind of dress code?',

'series': 'Debunking',

'author': 'Henry Hazard',

'sermon': 'My philosophy is that you come to church to worship God, not to impress people with your clothes.  Many people dress up because they want to look their best when they worship God.  Others come wearing what is comfortable.  As long as what you wear is decent, we do not have a dress code in our church.'
